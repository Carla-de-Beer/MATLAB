function centroids = computeCentroids(X, idx, K)
%COMPUTECENTROIDS returns the new centroids by computing the means of the
%data points assigned to each centroid.
%   centroids = COMPUTECENTROIDS(X, idx, K) returns the new centroids by
%   computing the means of the data points assigned to each centroid. It is
%   given a dataset X where each row is a single data point, a vector
%   idx of centroid assignments (i.e. each entry in range [1..K]) for each
%   example, and K, the number of centroids. You should return a matrix
%   centroids, where each row of centroids is the mean of the data points
%   assigned to it.

% Useful variables
[m n] = size(X);

% Return variable
centroids = zeros(K, n);

% Go over every centroid and compute mean of all points that
% belong to it. Concretely, the row vector centroids(i, :)
% should contain the mean of the data points assigned to
% centroid i.
%
% Note: You can use a for-loop over the centroids to compute this.

for i = 1:K
    c = idx == i; % get the matches
    c_matrix = repmat(c, 1, n); % get correct matrix size
    X_c = X .* c_matrix; % null out the unwanted rows
    total = sum(c); % get the sum total
    centroids(i, :) = sum(X_c) ./ total;
