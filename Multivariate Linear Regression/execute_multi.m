%% ================ Multivariate Linear Regression ===============

% Based on the Coursera Machine Learning course.
% Data set: Discrimination in salaries
% http://data.princeton.edu/wws509/datasets/#salary
% Created: January 2017

% Task: Given a dataset on personal data of university staff, predict the salary,
% in $, of a proposed employee, using linear regression with feature
% normalisation. Cross-check the results using normal equations.

% The variables are:
% sx = Sex, coded 1 for female and 0 for male
% rk = Rank, coded
%  - 1 for assistant professor,
%  - 2 for associate professor, and
%  - 3 for full professor
% yr = Number of years in current rank
% dg = Highest degree, coded 1 if doctorate, 0 if masters
% yd = Number of years since highest degree was earned
% sl = Academic year salary, in dollars.
