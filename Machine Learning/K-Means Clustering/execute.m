%% ================ K-Means Clustering ===============

% Based on the Coursera Machine Learning course.
%
% Using K-Means Clusterting to find cluster groups in a data set.
% The algorithm is run 5 times, with a maximum of 10 iteratiosn each.
% The centroid positions are randomly initialised each time.
